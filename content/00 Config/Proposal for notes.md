## Sprint planning
1. Tickets - links to Jira and other resources
2. Future tickets
3. Meetings

Tickets are across #SSP #SSG #SSM #SSC (for now). We will probably introduce a new ticket structure when we start #v3 after finishing up #v2
#sgv2 also...

## Mechanics (simplified)
1. Actions
2. Creations (generations), collectables, #PostCards

	1. Uploads/fetching & packaging - dumps to/from researchers
5. Alerts, dialogue, milestones

## Code & content
1. API integrations
2. Data dumps - e.g. from #Zooniverse 
3. Database
	1. Database migrations
4. Locations
	1. Scenes
	2. Structures

# Proposed flow
1. Everything is mentioned in a ticket and designated to a sprint. Each item has a ticket category (Jira project, see above), a mechanic, and a component (or component dir) and scene.
2. This ticket is then created and mentions those above entities

Parent tickets/stories, linked by sprints...
## Sprints
#Sprint-Planning 
Each sprint should have the following:
1. Overall goal, split into stories
2. Any cross-over or follow-ups from previous sprint
3. Future ticket plan
4. Any meeting notes
