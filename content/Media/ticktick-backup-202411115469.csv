Can fork anomalies/terrariums (these would be considered to have ""life energy"" (or something similar but less wanky)). Export anomalies/classifications to produce outputs that can then be compared with a sim environment (at a later date), add a consensus layer, add stardust, add some minimal spaceships scenes/functionality. Once we have enough content and consensus, can integrate SETI & similar projects (which then leads into some more fictional-driven parts of the narrative). Galaxy map that will then be divided into sectors, individual location anomaly sectors, and then generating perlin noise from everything to begin producing a map view.","N","2024-10-25T00:30:00+0000","2024-10-25T00:30:00+0000","PT0S","","0","0","2024-10-24T11:04:48+0000","","-8070450532280172544","Australia/Perth","false","false","Done","0","kanban","121",""
